# PDF QA PoC

This is a proof of concept to make use of [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) til extract information from a PDF file and answer questions about it.

## Installation

Requirements:
- Python 3.11
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

```bash
pipenv sync
pipenv shell
```

This will fetch the dependencies and create a virtual environment.

You can now access the Jupyter notebook ./pdf-poc.ipynb to see the code in action.
